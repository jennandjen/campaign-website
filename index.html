		<h6>Jenn Klipp Family</h6>
	</div>  
	<div class="storyright">
	   <p>Jenn Klipp was born and raised in Flint, Michigan. After graduating from Kearsley High School in 1991, she received her Bachelor of Art in English Literature from Hillsdale College, and has since taken dozens of graduate level courses concentrating on Educational Leadership and Curriculum Development and Design from Eastern Michigan University and NMU. After graduation, Jenn traveled extensively in the US and abroad before landing in the Keweenaw where she taught at Lake Linden-Hubbell schools for four years before returning to Flint with her husband. She taught at Flint Beecher for 6 years, and while there she designed and implemented the only board-certified Advanced Placement curriculum in literature in an urban school district in the State of Michigan. When her husband, Taylor, was offered the opportunity to establish a new office in the upper Great Lakes region, they gratefully moved back to the Upper Peninsula with their daughter, Lotus.  In 2013, Jenn took a teaching position in the Ishpeming school district where she has been teaching for over 7 years. Throughout her career, Jenn has served in various leadership roles, most notably spearheading a committee that partnered with the State of Michigan to bring a district out of financial insolvency. Jenn has developed original curriculum in her districts, including a Humanities curriculum that was recognized by the State of Michigan in its Teaching Excellence initiative in 2017.</p>
	  <p>Since moving to Marquette in 2009, Jenn and her husband, Taylor, have been engaged in local and regional community service, from serving in local city commissions and boards, to charitable work with their church,  to volunteering in various positions that serve people in poverty. Their daughter, Lotus, is now starting her first year at Bothwell Middle School. Jenn recognizes the excellence already present in the MAPS system, and is anxious to help it strengthen and grow. Jenn knows that for schools and families to effectively work together for their children, parents and students must feel respected and valued. She is committed to help MAPS provide a welcoming and inclusive environment for all students, regardless of socio-economic status, race, gender, or religion. In order to ensure this, Jenn recognizes that decision-makers must be brave enough follow an evidence-based, data-driven approach that fosters a healthy school culture and promotes student well-being.</p>

	<div class="storyright">
	   <p>Jen grew up in Evanston, IL and was transplanted to Marquette, Michigan her senior year of high school, graduating from MSHS in 1983. She then attended the University of Michigan, during which she took a number of gap years to travel and study Spanish and French. Jen put herself through college by working multiple jobs and creating side businesses, which enabled her to finish her degree in Political Science while living in Chicago.</p> 
		<p>After working in the political consulting and non-profit arenas for a number of years, Jen chose to stay home with her three kids. The desire to raise their kids in a small, Midwest town brought Jen and her husband, Tom Vear, back to Marquette in 2001. Jen proceeded to home school her kids until they each decided to attend public school at Marquette Senior High School. In 2007, Jen and Tom refurbished and re-opened Donckers. Eight years later, they opened the Delft Bistro. Jen has a demonstrated ability to focus on fine details while keeping sight of a bigger picture. Her passion has always been a combination of helping people and creating an environment where everyone feels welcome. She is passionate about the community of Marquette and is dedicated to working hard to ensure MAPS continues to provide an exceptional nurturing learning environment for children in our community.</p>
