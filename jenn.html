	   <p>On Tuesday, July 22, I filed to run for a seat on the Marquette Area Public Schools Board of Education.</p>
<p>Many who do not know me well will associate my name with Redmen nickname controversy. My conviction is that Redmen, regardless of origin or intent, does not unify our local school district. This has been a point of contention in our community for 20 years.</p>
<p>On July 20th, Chairman Payment, democratically elected chairperson for the local Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians, reiterated this position in an article published by the Detroit Free Press.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in 2017, the 12 federally recognized tribes in Michigan were united in crafting a resolution to end all mascots, nicknames, and logos associated with Native Americans. Furthermore, Michigan High School Athletic Association spokesperson, Geoff Kimmerly, stated, “Mascots and nicknames should be inclusive and unifying…never divisive,” in the same article.</p>
<p>However, a candidate for a six-year term should never run on a single issue. It would not serve the school body nor the community at large.</p>
<p>In my almost 20 years in public education, I have worked for two Upper Peninsula districts, as well as a large urban district, as I followed my husband´s career advancement.</p>
<p>This allowed me to serve in several leadership roles and provided challenging and instrumental opportunities to serve students and communities: I have worked in partnership with the state of Michigan to restructure a district and move it out of financial insolvency. I have crafted state recognized curriculum, highlighted three years ago in Michigan’s Educators and Excellence program.</p>
<p>I have served as a curriculum peer-coach with other teachers, worked on behalf of schools to meet Title 1 designations and NCA accreditations, School Improvement Teams, and, perhaps most proudly, drafted and implemented the first Advanced Placement course in Literature in an urban district in the state of Michigan.</p>
<p>My focus for 20 years has been kids, parents, and public schools.</p>
<p>Therefore, while the nickname issue at MAPS is concerning, my focus as a parent and a potential school board member, is rooted in the vision and development of the MAPS community.</p>
<p>The first challenge all schools face is the rolling out of safe CVD-19 plans. School leaders and stakeholders are hard at work already, but as we face the uncertainty of the next year or two, I adamantly believe that a classroom teacher´s voice should be at the table. Beyond the public health crisis, the struggles of day to day operations and logistics may go unheard without that voice.</p> 
<p>As I prepare for my own school year teaching at another district I worry about the logistics of finding enough subs when there is already a severe shortage. I wonder what traveling in the halls, locker assignments, disinfectant protocols, social distancing, and lunch service will look like.</p>
<p>How can we ensure that students and staff are safe while protecting the integrity of teaching every child wherever she or he is?</p>
<p>Taking a longer view, I hope to support this district as it partners with two excellent universities, and a variety of innovative businesses within our area. What opportunities are there for support and overhauls of our existing science labs, our amazing building trade program, or our existing partnership with NMU´s Middle College? What partnerships can be created between local businesses and manufacturers and our students? How do our buildings need to change to remain an exceptional district? How much farther could we go?</p>
<p>Let’s focus diligently, and with unity, on preparing all of our students for a 21st century learning experience beyond the classroom walls. Let’s work to ensure that all students regardless of economic status, or race, or religion feel safe, welcomed, and inspired by the MAPS community. Let’s keep esteemed traditions that serve all students and reimagine those that don’t.</p>
<p>We can all agree that the future is uncertain, the cloudiest I can remember in my two decades as an educator.</p>
<p>But regardless of all of the challenges seen and unseen that our school will face in the coming years, let’s put kids, and their futures, first!</p>
